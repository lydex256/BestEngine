# Godot Project Zip
With this add-on you can zip up a project excluding the .godot and, if present, .git folders. This results in a smaller zip file.

## Supports Godot 4.1+
This plugin requires Godot 4.1 and newer versions.

## Installation
This plugin can be installed via the Godot asset library. Just Search for Godot Project Zip.

## Usage

To have your project zip file created just select Zip Project from the Project -> Tools sub menu.

Once the zip file has been created the following confirmation dialog will show.

</p>


All zip files are stored in user://. A new zip file is created each time, so it's probably a good idea to clear them out after you no longer need them.

To see the user:// folder in the file explorer at any time you can select Open User Data Folder from the Project menu.
